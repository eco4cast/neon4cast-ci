You can represent your confidence (i.e., uncertainty in forecast) using a distribution or numerically using an ensemble (or sample) of predictions.\n\n\n2.3 Any model drivers/covariates/features are welcome\nYou can use any data as inputs. This includes all the targets data available to date. All sensor-based target data is available in near-real time (1 day latency). You may want to use the updated target data to re-train a model or use in data assimilation.\nAs this is a genuine forecasting challenge, you will need forecasted drivers if your model uses drivers as inputs. If you are interested in using forecasted meteorology, we have developed R functions that provide access to the NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting model forecasts for each NEON site.\n\n\n2.4 Forecasts horizon depends on the variable forecasted\nForecasts can be submitted 1 day to 1 year ahead. The sensor-based targets are 10 to 30 days ahead while the community and population targets are 1 year ahead.\n\n\n2.5 Forecasts can be submitted everyday\nSince forecasts can be submitted everyday, automation is important. We provide an example GitHub repository that can be used to automate your forecast with GitHub Actions. It also includes the use of a custom Docker Container eco4cast/rocker-neon4cast:latest that has many of the packages and functions needed to generate and submit forecasts."
