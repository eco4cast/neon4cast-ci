The first site in the list is the recommended starting site.\n\nTerrestrial: BART, OSBS, KONZ, SRER\nAquatics: BARC, CRAM\nPhenology: HARV, BART, STEI, UKFS, GRSM, DELA, CLBJ\nBeetles: BLAN, OSBS\nTicks: BLAN, TALL\n\nAs you develop your forecasting skills and want to expand to more sites, the targets are available at all 81 NEON sites. You may also consider submitting forecasts to sites that match your interests. For example, a class being taught in the winter may be more interested in forecasting southern sites while a summer class may focus on more northern sites.\nMore information about NEON sites can be found in the site metadata and on NEON’s website"

    "text": "2 Generating a forecast\n\n2.1 All forecasting approaches are welcome\nWe encourage you to use any modeling approach to make a prediction about the future conditions at any of the NEON sites and variables.\n\n\n2.2 Must include uncertainty\nForecasts require you to make an assessment of the confidence in your prediction of the future. You can represent your confidence (i.e., uncertainty in the forecast) using a distribution or numerically using an ensemble (or sample) of predictions.\n\n\n2.3 Any model drivers/covariates/features are welcome\nYou can use any data as model inputs (including all of the forecast target data available to date). All sensor-based target data are available in with a 1 to 7 day delay (latency) from time of collection. You may want to use the updated target data to re-train a model or for use in data assimilation.\nAs a genuine forecasting challenge, you will need forecasted drivers if your model uses drivers as inputs. If you are interested in using forecasted meteorology, we are downloading and processing NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) weather forecasts for each NEON site. The NOAA GEFS forecasts extend 35-days ahead. More information about accessing the weather forecasts can be found here\n\n\n2.4 Forecasts can be for a range of horizons\nForecasts can be submitted for 1 day to 1 year-ahead, depending on the variable. See the variable tables for the horizon that is associated with each variable.\n\n\n2.5 Forecasts can be submitted everyday\nSince forecasts can be submitted everyday, automation is important. We provide an example GitHub repository that can be used to automate your forecast with GitHub Actions. It also includes the use of a custom Docker Container eco4cast/rocker-neon4cast:latest that has many of the packages and functions needed to generate and submit forecasts.\nWe only evaluate forecasts for any weekly variables (e.g., beetles and ticks) that were submitted on the Sunday of each week. Therefore we recommend only submitting forecasts of the weekly variables on Sundays."

This is referred to as a “perfect ensemble” by Bröcker and Smith (2007). Ensemble (or sample) forecasts are transformed to a probability distribution function (e.g., dressed) using the default methods in the scoringRules R package (empirical version of the quantile decomposition for the crps).\n\n\n5.1 Example forecasts\nHere is an example of a forecast that uses a normal distribution:\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/forecasts/raw/T20231102190926_aquatics-2023-10-19-climatology.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\ndf |&gt; \n  head() |&gt; \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel_id\ndatetime\nreference_datetime\nsite_id\nfamily\nparameter\nvariable\nprediction\n\n\n\n\nclimatology\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nARIK\nnormal\nmu\noxygen\n4.542862\n\n\nclimatology\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nARIK\nnormal\nsigma\noxygen\n1.448393\n\n\nclimatology\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nARIK\nnormal\nmu\ntemperature\n8.070854\n\n\nclimatology\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nARIK\nnormal\nsigma\ntemperature\n1.330059\n\n\nclimatology\n2023-10-21\n2023-10-19\nARIK\nnormal\nmu\noxygen\n4.194895\n\n\nclimatology\n2023-10-21\n2023-10-19\nARIK\nnormal\nsigma\noxygen\n1.448393\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an ensemble (or sample) forecast, the family column uses the word ensemble to designate that it is a ensemble forecast and the parameter column is the ensemble member number (1, 2, 3 …)\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/forecasts/raw/T20231102190926_aquatics-2023-10-19-persistenceRW.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\ndf |&gt; \n  dplyr::arrange(variable, site_id, datetime, parameter) |&gt; \n  head() |&gt; \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel_id\ndatetime\nreference_datetime\nsite_id\nfamily\nparameter\nvariable\nprediction\n\n\n\n\npersistenceRW\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nBARC\nensemble\n1\nchla\n3.795652\n\n\npersistenceRW\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nBARC\nensemble\n2\nchla\n3.963322\n\n\npersistenceRW\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nBARC\nensemble\n3\nchla\n2.053637\n\n\npersistenceRW\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nBARC\nensemble\n4\nchla\n3.294723\n\n\npersistenceRW\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nBARC\nensemble\n5\nchla\n1.847344\n\n\npersistenceRW\n2023-10-20\n2023-10-19\nBARC\nensemble\n6\nchla\n7.829229"
