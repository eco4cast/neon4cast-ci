The following elements of a forecasting challenge workflow are included in this repo. The GitHub Actions are the tool for automating the tasks.

1)  Generation of targets
2)  Processing of submissions
3)  Generation of baseline forecasts
4)  Evaluation (scoring) of submitted forecasts
5)  Generation of Quarto dashboard
6)  Generation of STAC catalog
